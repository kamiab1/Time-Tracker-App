## Contributing
Each contributor's IDE are configured differently so there will be dependency errors when trying to build and run the project. To fix this, follow the steps below:

1. Create a *new* Codename One project
2. Select the correct Project SDK (which should be *Azul Zulu Open JDK FX Version 11 or greater*)
3. Set the Package Name to *org.ecs160.a2*
4. Set the Main Class Name to *AppMain*
5. Set the Project Name to *Time-Tracker-App* and hit finish to create the project.
6. Copy and replace the *src* folder from the repository into your new project folder that you have just created.
7. Build and run the project to make sure that it works without any errors!


## NOTE : only upload the src folder and nothing else

When pushing out changes to GitHub, clone the repository and push out only the *src* folder. Do not include any dependency folders that are specific to your IDE installation.
