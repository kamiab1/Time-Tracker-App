2. Select the correct Project SDK (which should be Azul Zulu Open JDK FX Version 11 or greater)
3. Set the Package Name to org.ecs160.a2
4. Set the Main Class Name to AppMain
5. Set the Project Name to Time-Tracker-App
6. Copy the src folder into your project folder
7. Build and run the project to make sure that it works without any errors!
